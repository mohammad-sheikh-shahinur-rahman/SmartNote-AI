## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 70%, 50% (equivalent to hex code #1982c4). This blue creates a clean and focused feel.
- Background color: HSL 210, 20%, 95% (equivalent to hex code #F0F4F8). This very light, desaturated blue will provide a calm and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 60%, 50% (equivalent to hex code #26BFB0). This creates an energetic visual callout.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern and readable interface.

- Clean, minimal layout with clear spacing and visual hierarchy.
- Use subtle animations for transitions and interactions to enhance user experience.
